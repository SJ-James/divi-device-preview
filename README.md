# divi-device-preview
Preview your websites in a unique way with an iframe that toggles between devices.

# how-to-install
1. Click the green 'clone or download' button and choose 'Download as Zip.
2. This can then be installed just like any standard WP plugin.
3. That's it, the device preview module will be available in your modules.

# about-this-plugin
This plugin is a simple example of how modules can be created 
and added to Divi. I'll update it to hook into the front end editor 
as and when documentation is released.
